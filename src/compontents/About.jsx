                            <p>
                                Years of professional experience and a curious mind have
                                honed my dedication and persistence. As a software
                                engineer, I take a holistic approach to creating a final
                                product that not only incorporates the end user
                                experience, but analyzes how the efficiency of each step
                                of the process can be improved. I not only bring the
                                satisfaction that a task given to me is a task done to
                                your unique specifications, but I bring my own tea.

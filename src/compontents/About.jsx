                                        Years of professional experience and a curious mind have
                                        honed my dedication and persistence. As a software
                                        engineer, I take a holistic approach to creating a final
                                        product that not only incorporates the end user
                                        experience, but analyzes how the efficiency of each step
                                        of the process can be improved. I not only bring the
                                        satisfaction that a task given to me is a task done to
                                        your unique specifications, but I bring my own tea.
